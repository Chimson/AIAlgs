TODO:

Make Example its own class
Make the DecisionTree class hold some data attributes, which will
  remove a lot of the function arguments in
DecisionTree.Learner() need to return function T(e),
  where e is an example in the training set, for all e in the set
  should be able to return some kind of delagate or lambda 
Decide static vs non-static functions
Decide on public vs private members

Example of T(e) Tree function
e = ["Known", "New", "Short", "Work", "Reads"]
T(e) = IfThen(cond)
